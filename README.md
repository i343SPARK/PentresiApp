# Pentresí App

This is an application developed with the SwiftUI framework, which is an app designed for organizing cultural and local events in a city. It includes a feature for reading descriptions and histories of past events, aimed at capturing users' attention and inviting them to participate in upcoming events.

This app was developed for academic purposes by Tecmilenio for a class where we were asked to develop an app for a company. The project's focus was to create something useful for real-life applications and to demonstrate our skills in the mobile app development certification.
